tips
====

The purpose of those tips is to provide a set of useful reminders for commands,
syntax or files formats related to all the differents softwares we are using
everyday which are not using the same syntax because it would be too easy ;)

Each set of tips is regrouped in a .md file. The goal is to have short .md files
to remember the essential and not write the full manual in a single .md file.
If a .md file becomes too big (more than 2 pages), it will be cut in several 
files, each related to a functional domain for the software.

Feel free to suggest new tips files or really useful forgotten tips for the 
currents.
