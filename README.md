tips
====

The purpose of those tips id to provide a set of useful reminders for commands,
syntax or files formats related to all the differents softwares we are using
everyday and which are not all using the same syntax because it would be too 
easy if they will ;)

Each set of tips is regrouped in a .md file. The goal i to have shot .md files
to remember the essential and not crite the full manual in a single .md file.
If a .md file become too big (more than 2 pages), it will be cut in several 
files, each related to a function domain for the software.

Feel free to suggest new tips files or really useful forgotten tips for the 
currents.
